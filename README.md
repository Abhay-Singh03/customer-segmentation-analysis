# customer-segmentation-analysis
SQL + Python (RFM Clustering) + Power BI project for customer segmentation and sales insights
# üìä Customer Segmentation & Sales Insights (SQL + ML + Power BI)

## üîπ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-world data analytics workflow** across three key domains:
1. **SQL (Data Cleaning & Analysis)** ‚Üí preparing and analyzing raw retail transactions.  
2. **Machine Learning (Python - Jupyter Notebook)** ‚Üí RFM analysis and clustering to segment customers.  
3. **Power BI (Visualization & Dashboarding)** ‚Üí interactive report for business insights.  

The dataset is based on the **Online Retail dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle).

## üîπ Dataset
- **Source**: [Online Retail Dataset ‚Äì UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)  
- **Format**: Excel/CSV (500k+ rows)  
- **Fields**:
  - `InvoiceNo`: Transaction ID (prefix "C" = cancelled order)  
  - `StockCode`: Product code  
  - `Description`: Product description  
  - `Quantity`: Units bought  
  - `InvoiceDate`: Date of transaction  
  - `UnitPrice`: Price per unit  
  - `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier  
  - `Country`: Customer location

-- üìå Data Cleaning
------------------------------------------------------------

-- Remove null customers
DELETE FROM OnlineRetail WHERE CustomerID IS NULL;

-- Remove cancelled invoices (Invoice starting with 'C')
DELETE FROM OnlineRetail WHERE InvoiceNo LIKE 'C%';

-- Remove negative or zero quantities
DELETE FROM OnlineRetail WHERE Quantity <= 0;

-- Add TotalAmount column
ALTER TABLE OnlineRetail ADD TotalAmount FLOAT;

-- Update TotalAmount = Quantity * UnitPrice
UPDATE OnlineRetail
SET TotalAmount = Quantity * UnitPrice;
